# **PROJECT TITLE: MOBILE ROBOT MOTION PLANNING**This project mainly focuses on the localization and motion planning of a Mobile robot (Alpha Bot). In this attempt we used a OPENCV library to make the robot to retrieve the co-ordinates from the desired location and move towards it. To make this happen the robot is equipped with Raspberry pi microcontroller, Ultraviolet, IR sensors and camera sensors. The Raspberry Pi is connected with the Linux system via Ethernet. We can activate the code remotely from our desktop using Raspberry pi Linux terminal.**Getting Started:**1. **Prerequisites:** - ALPHA BOT- MOBILE ROBOT - Raspberry pi programming - Feedback Control system - OPEN CV library2. **Installation:** - Assemble the Mobile bot as per the instructions given in     **Link:** [https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/c/c7/AlphaBot-User-Manual.pdf](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/c/c7/AlphaBot-User-Manual.pdf) - Connect the raspberry pi board to the PC to activate the remote Linux desktop     **Link:** [https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-laptop-display](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-laptop-display) - Install Open CV2     In the linux terminal            1. conda create -n opencv python=3.8            2. conda activate opencv            3. pip install opencv -python     To verify the installation:            1.   python            2. \_\_version\_\_ - Install yaml     In the linux terminal            1. pip install pyyaml3. **Run:** - Place the ARUCO markers with different QR code at the desired locations before starting the bot. - After the setup of the mobile robot and the circuit, run the main\_code.py in the terminal window of Linux remote desktop. - After running the code, the robot starts to search the markers around it. After searching the marker, it retrieves the distance by using the camera sensor. - Then the robot moves to the location. After reaching it does the same procedure and moves to every location. Thus, the bot localizes itself in the global co-ordinate system.
